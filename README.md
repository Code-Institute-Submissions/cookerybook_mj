UX
</h2>

<p>The project required building a data driven web application using the technologies learned throughout the Data Centric Development modules.  This being the premise, a database schema were designed based on recipes and other related properties such as categories i.e - Quick and Easy, worldwide cuisines, healthy and such like.  It also included ingredients and method of cooking, special tips to assist the user.</p>
<p>The backend code allows the user to add recipes and categories through the frontend forms and each form has a variety of popout input blocks.  It also has the facility to edit both the categories and recipes if required, the data is saved at the Mongo Database.  Using Materialize framework at the frontend incorporating subtle styling gives the user a clean look to the page.</P>
